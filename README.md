# Example-socket-Python
Socket example ussing Python v3.0
This example has two codes. One of them is the server code and the other is the client example code.

How it works?  The server send a file to the client. The file used is the same server's code to make it more easy. How we are launching the server and the clien in the same machine we use localhost direction. How we are copying the server code we have to put the server in other folder.
